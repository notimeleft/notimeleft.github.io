	<h1>Life, Liberty and the pursuit of App-yness</h1>
	<p> Hi there, I'm Jerry - Welcome to my sparse and milquetoast home page. It is my ambition to fill this page with my current software projects.</p> 
	<ul>
	<p>Check out my first published iOS app, a drawing app that listens to your voice/music library: <a href="/SongBrush">SongBrush</a></p>
	
	<li><a href = "https://github.com/notimeleft/QRCodeContacts"> Here</a> is my Contacts app, built for a coding challenge. It has basic CRUD, search, and sharing functions via Core Data, UISearchController, and Core Image plus AVFoundation for QR code generation and detection.</li>
	<li><a href = "https://github.com/notimeleft/LeafParticlesDemo">Here's</a> a simulation of leaf particles affected by gravity and touch events, built via SpriteKit and CoreMotion</p>
	<li><a href = "https://github.com/notimeleft/TreeBrushDemo">This</a> is a fractal tree animation with leaves and twinkling stars in the background. Still a work in progress, also using Spritekit, Core Animation and Core motion. </li>
	<li><a href = "https://github.com/notimeleft/PostRequestScript">This</a> is a simple python script that makes a POST request to send my base64-encoded resume to a company's server via its API endpoint. I'm oddly fond of this one.</li>
	</ul>
