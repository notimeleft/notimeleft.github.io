	<h1>Life, Liberty and the pursuit of App-yness</h1>
	<p> Hi there! I'm Jerry - Welcome to my sparse and milquetoast home page. It is my ambition to fill this page with the various projects currently occupying my interests. Currently I'm trying to cram as much ballroom dancing into my muscle memory as possible so I've put my software fiddling on the backburner for now.</p> 

	<p>Next up: building custom chatbots so I can ask Nietzsche, Shakespeare and Mickey Hahn for advice on making the ideal breakfast of champions (like, a literal breakfast), and other assorted nonsequiturs.</p>
