my portfolio page, hosted kindly by github pages!

Note to future self: the reason why there are so many commits for this repo is because I edited the html files using Github's web files interface, and committed every minor change by hand. Next time, it's probably prudent to just write html and test with local host. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
