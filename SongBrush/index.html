<strong>(anticipated) Frequently Asked Questions</strong>
<br/>
<br/>    
<strong>Where do the colors come from?</strong>

<p>The brush's colors correspond with the pitch and volume of your voice. </p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the 7 notes of the musical scale correspond to these colors:</p>

<p>C-------D-------E-------F-------G-------A-------B</p>
<p>red---orange---yellow---green---blue---indigo---violet</p>

<p>Silence (when detected volume is lower than a defined threshold) results in a solid white color. </p>

<p>The note octave alters the final hue of the color. For example, C5 produces a shade of red closer to orange than to the hue of C2. </p>

<p>The loudness of your voice alters the brighness of the color and the amplitude of the sine curve drawn on screen. The louder you sing into the mic, or the louder the music track, the wider the paint strokes on screen. Try blowing on your mic without using earplugs to see the results! </p>

<strong> What gestures are available?</strong>

<p>Pinch the screen outwardly and release your fingers from the screen to clear the canvas with a ripple effect.  Use the tip of your finger to paint a regular brushstroke.  Use a large portion of your finger to smear the brushstroke. </p>
