			<p>iOS developer in the Bay. Is it safe to declare myself to the world? Well, nobody's gonna see this page anyway, so I think it's safe enough.</p>
      <p>Too meek and timid, you say? How about: I am a writer and engineer, artist and dancer. I strive to balance the arts and sciences elegantly in my work and in my passions.</p>
	<p>Come find me on Reddit, at Fanime, and in various social dance groups across the Bay...</p>
	<p>Left this page rather sparse and poorly formatted. Sorry, prospective employers!</p>
